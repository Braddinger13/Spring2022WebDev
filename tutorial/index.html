        <h1>Flipping Filterable Image Cards with Typewriter Title</h1>
        
        <p>
            For my tutorial project, I made a filterable gallery that a has mouse on-hover event that flips the card
            around and shows the title of the picture on the back, as well as displaying the title in typewriter fashion.
            Each picture has tags that are used for filtering. To filter images, there are buttons that have the tag names
            and apply filtering when clicked. The cards can be flipped when hovered over. To use this component, you need
            to pass an object with two parameters to the make function. This object should contain a field for "title", as
            well as "artList" that holds a list of objects with the fields "name", "image", and "tags". "name" will be the
            name that appears on the back of the card, while "image" appears on the front. "tags" should be a contain
            the tags you want to filter by in a space separated string.

            This snippet is a simplified version of how I built my <strong>Buttons</strong> that were used to filter my cards.

            This last snippet shows how I got the cards to have the <strong>180 flipping effect</strong>, showing the back of the card
            upon hover. Click <a href="https://css-borders-modified.w3spaces.com/180FlippingCard.html" target="_blank">here</a>
            to see the flipping code.
