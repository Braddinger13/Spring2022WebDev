/* To implement dropDowns, we have these styling elements: 

     - NavRouter:  this is the whole navigation bar (that is created by MakeNavRouter.js)

     - NavGroup:   a div that either contains a link or contains a NavGroup header followed by 
                   a SubMenu (that contains links). 

     - SubMenu:    initially hidden, but becomes visible when its associated NavGroup header 
                   is clicked.
