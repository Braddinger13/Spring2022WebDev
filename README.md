# Spring2022WebDev

This was a project that I completed throughout the enirety of my Spring 2022 semester at Temple University.
It is accessible at this link: http://cis-linux2.temple.edu:8080/SP22_3308_tuk81273/index.html

I did not wrtite every single file in this repository!!!!!
Many of the files in here are from Sally Kyvernitis, my professor that semester.

The tutorial component is a part of this website that was completely self-started and finished.

Skills learned during this project range from frontend to backend.
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: WebApis, MySQL/Database
